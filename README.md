# OSA-Library
This python optimization software library tackles the office space allocation (OSA) problem. This is my Masters (MSc Computer Science) Dissertation project.

The Office Space Allocation Problem in an academic setting refers to the assignment of a set of available spaces (such as office rooms or classrooms ) to a set of entities (such as employees, departments, or groups) in a way that reduces space wastage and satisfies additional imposed constraints. This dissertation provides a software library implementation to tackle this problem. 

It includes heuristics and procedures (Python Files) that:
1) Read in text file dataset containing entity, room and constraint information
2) Then constructs an initial solution/entity-space allocation
3) Then explores the neighbourhood search space of that initial allocation to find the best feasible solution/entity-space allocation
4) Then finally provides this best feasible solution/allocation as output to a text file. 

The documentation pdf and the dissertation pdf together will provide comprehensive information regarding the project.
